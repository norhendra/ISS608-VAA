<p>For fluidity of the prototype, I will be incorporating the data preparation and plots used under each page of the UI design throughout the storyboard. The data preparation for each plot will be done within the plots’ code chunk according to their specific needs.</p>
<p>The group has decided to do MC1 - <a href="https://vast-challenge.github.io/2025/MC1.html" class="uri">https://vast-challenge.github.io/2025/MC1.html</a> which is a challenge to unravel the impact of Sailor Shift and the Oceanus Folk genre.</p>

<h1>2. Design Innovation</h1>
<p>For this mini-challenge, I propose a Spotify-inspired interface to explore Sailor Shift’s career and the diffusion of Oceanus Folk within a knowledge-graph framework. By leveraging familiar music-streaming conventions, the design aligns domain context with user expectations, facilitates intuitive navigation of complex network data, and enhances engagement through interactive discovery patterns.</p>
<p>There are two important things to take note here: <strong>Heuristics</strong> and <strong>Mental Model.</strong> At the heart of my design lies the notion of a <strong>mental model</strong> which is the internal roadmap users build from prior experience with similar interfaces. Consider everyday digital interactions outside of music apps: at an ATM, a green “Enter” button and red “Cancel” button follow a universal color heuristic, so users immediately know which to press without reading instructions. In ecommerce sites, a shopping-cart icon in the header reliably signals where items aggregate for checkout, exemplifying the <strong>consistency and standards</strong> heuristic. On mapping apps, pinch-to-zoom and swipe-to-pan gestures obey the <strong>recognition-rather-than-recall</strong> principle as users don’t need to learn new gestures for each location. Even smartphone home screens employ a grid of app icons, a visual metaphor that people of all ages recognize as launch points.</p>
<p>By borrowing Spotify’s signature dark canvas (deep charcoal backdrops, neon-green accents), minimalist iconography, and rounded “card” elements, we tap directly into that pre-existing framework. Our Shiny dashboard taps directly into users’ <strong>existing mental model</strong> of a streaming interface. This isn’t just about looking cool, it leverages <strong>cognitive affordances</strong> that make filters, charts, and network nodes feel instantly familiar. When viewers see glowing emerald highlights on active selections or hover-activated cards that resemble album art, their brains automatically map those cues to music discovery behaviors they’ve internalized. This isn’t merely an aesthetic choice; it leverages key <strong>heuristics</strong> which are cognitive shortcuts that speed up interaction.</p>
<p>This design strategy minimizes learning overhead and audiences don’t have to decode a new UI language to explore Oceanus Folk’s network; instead, they engage with data through the same visual shorthand that guides their favorite music apps. The high-contrast palette also enhances visual cognition, making multi-series line plots and node graphs pop against a dark field, so patterns in Sailor Shift’s collaborations leap off the screen. In sum, by mirroring Spotify’s color palette and layout principles, we create a <strong>cognitively intuitive</strong>, <strong>emotionally resonant</strong> environment that feels musical at first glance.</p>
<p>Currently, Spotify UI web design looks like below:</p>

<p><img src="images/clipboard-1572780874.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Spotify uses the above colour palette as above image. Specifically, Spotify is known for its neon green accent #1db954, and the rest are dark-charcoal colors.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dashboard-plots">3.2 Dashboard Plots</h2>
<p>To give this challenge a seamless, story-driven exploration of Oceanus Folk and Sailor Shift’s impact, I have organized the visual analytics dashboard into four linked views.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Summary Page</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this page is to provide a high level snapshot where it provides a plot from each question. The question can mainly be broken down into the artist Sailor Shift, the genre Oceanus Folk and other top artists.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sailor Shift Page</strong></p>
<p>This page would map Sailor Shift’s personal connections and lineage. It will show who she has been most influenced by over time and who she has collaborated with. In essence, this provides and inwards and outwards influences of Sailor Shift.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oceanus Folk</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the Sailor Shift page, this will also examine the genre’s collective evolution and external reach. It will measure which genres have influenced Oceanus Folk and vice versa. Furthermore, it will show how Sailor Shift’s influence has shaped Oceanus Folk and how it affected other genres positively.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Top Artists</strong></p>
<p>This is to profile rising stars and forecast future talents. It will show the top artists and also notable songs to visualize the careers of top artists and predict the next Oceanus Folk stars.</p></li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ui-flow-and-components">3.2.1.1 UI Flow and Components</h4>
<p>The components of the UI would work as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Top Navigation Bar:</strong> A fixed bar at the top of the page that lets you switch quickly between the four thematic lenses: <em>Summary, Sailor Shift, Oceanus Folk,</em> and <em>Other Artists</em>. Selecting a tab refreshes every dependent panel so you always see coherent information for the chosen lens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Right Sidebar (Category Picker):</strong> The sidebar lets users choose a category, instantly displaying a concise introductory summary for the selection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Right Sidebar (Description of Summary):</strong> Directly beneath the picker, this panel gives a tight written brief introduction of the category chosen in selector. This allow users to absorb the headline insight before exploring the visuals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Main Plots:</strong> The centre stage where interactive charts live. On <strong>Summary</strong>, you’ll see three signature plots, one pulled from each of the other lenses to create an at-a-glance dashboard (think: Sailor’s outgoing influences, an Oceanus Folk influence visNetwork graph, and an interactive plot of rising artists).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Left Sidebar:</strong> A compact traywith sliders and drop-downs that refine the canvas in real time. On the <strong>Summary</strong> page you can choose which signature plots appear; within <em>Sailor Shift</em> you might want to see who she collaborated with or who has influenced her.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Play Button:</strong> A mini-player, complete with a Spotify-style play button which allows visitors <em>hear</em> Oceanus Folk for themselves. I’ve hand-picked a playlist of tracks whose textures, rhythms, and sea-salt harmonies capture the spirit of this fictional genre, drawn from years of obsessive music-digging. Press play, close your eyes, and the visuals on screen will suddenly have a soundtrack:</p>
<p><u><strong><em>What I think Oceanus Folk sounds like</em></strong></u></p>
<p>Oceanus Folk mixes gentle acoustic guitar or ukulele patterns with concertina or whistle lines and light, brushed percussion in a steady sway. Vocals are usually sung in close harmony, creating an intimate, communal feel, while subtle ambient sounds of waves, gull calls, the creak of docks sit low in the mix to place the listener by the sea. Modern touches such as soft synth pads or reverb-soaked electric-guitar swells keep it current without losing its coastal roots, giving the music a mellow, reflective mood that feels both nostalgic and quietly uplifting.</p>

<p>On the <strong>Sailor Shift</strong> tab you can explore her creative network from two complementary angles:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>“Influenced by Sailor Shift” graph</strong>: a visNetwork visualisation that maps every artist, band, album, song, or label touched by Sailor’s work. Follow direct collaborations, then pan outward to see second-degree ripples across the wider Oceanus Folk scene.</p>

<h1>4. Shiny Prototype</h1>
<p>I tested how it would look on Shiny, and below is a sample with the Shiny App I have built. It is not exactly similar as what I have charted on Figma, but I am trying to clone it as close as possible within the boundaries of a Shiny App.</p>
<p>I will be discussing this with my teammates to expand on this idea and work on the plots for each modules if they agree with this UI design and modules.</p>
